### 1. **Check the GraphQL Route Path**

In your configuration, you're registering `mercurius` for GraphQL but you haven't explicitly set the path for the GraphQL endpoint. By default, `mercurius` registers the endpoint at `/graphql`, not `/api/graphql`. If you want to change this to `/api/graphql`, you need to explicitly specify the path.

You can modify your `mercurius` registration to include the `path` option:

```js
app.register(mercurius, {
  schema,
  context: contextFn ?? ((request): Context => new Context(request, connection)),
  queryDepth: 10,
  subscription: getSubscriptionSettings(connection),
  graphiql: !isProd,  // Enable GraphiQL in non-production environments
  validationRules: isProd ? [NoSchemaIntrospectionCustomRule] : undefined,
  errorHandler: (error, request, reply) => {
    request.log.error({ err: error }, 'GraphQL Error');
    return error;
  },
  logLevel: 'debug',
  // Set the GraphQL endpoint to /api/graphql
  path: '/api/graphql',  
});
```

This will ensure that your GraphQL endpoint is accessible at `/api/graphql` instead of `/graphql`.

### 2. **Test the GraphQL Endpoint**

Now that the path is set, you should be able to make a POST request to `/api/graphql`. Try the following `curl` command again:

```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/graphql \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query": "{ __typename }"}'
```

If everything is configured correctly, you should get a valid response, like:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "__typename": "Query"
  }
}
```

### 3. **Enable Logging for Debugging**

You've already set up some logging in your Fastify instance. To further debug the issue, you can add more detailed logs for the GraphQL endpoint and the requests being handled by `mercurius`. You already have `logLevel: 'debug'` set, which should help. Additionally, you can add a more detailed logging hook for requests:

```js
app.addHook('onRequest', (request, reply, done) => {
  request.log.info({ url: request.url, method: request.method }, 'incoming request');
  done();
});
```

This will log each incoming request, which can help verify that the GraphQL route is being hit.

### 4. **Verify the Route is Registered**

After starting the server, you can verify that the `/api/graphql` route is correctly registered by using Fastify's `printRoutes()` functionality:

```js
app.ready(err => {
  if (err) throw err;
  console.log(app.printRoutes());
});
```

This will print out all the routes that Fastify has registered, and you should see `/api/graphql` among them.

### 5. **Testing with GraphiQL (Optional)**

If you're in a non-production environment, you can use the `graphiql` option to enable an in-browser GraphQL IDE for testing queries. By default, `mercurius` exposes GraphiQL at the same path as your GraphQL endpoint, so if you go to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/graphql` in your browser (because `graphiql: !isProd` is set), you should be able to interact with your API and test queries directly.

### 6. **Check for Reverse Proxy or Route Prefixing**

If you're running your Fastify server behind a reverse proxy (e.g., Nginx) or using a base path for all routes (e.g., `/api`), ensure that your proxy or routing is correctly configured. This can sometimes cause confusion where the route isn't correctly mapped to the Fastify server.

For example, if you're using a reverse proxy that maps `/api/graphql` to `/graphql`, you'll need to adjust the path accordingly in either the proxy or Fastify configuration.

### 7. **Other Considerations**

- **CORS**: You have CORS enabled via `@fastify/cors`, which is good. If you experience any issues with cross-origin requests (especially if your frontend is hosted separately), ensure that the `origin` and `credentials` options in the CORS configuration are set correctly.
  
- **Error Handling**: You have an error handler for Fastify, which is useful, but make sure you're checking the logs for any potential issues during startup or when handling requests.
